Using information from the first project , we found that 75% students wished they were more informed about seminars and would like to see more advertisement.  Our group decided that we could build a site to solve this problem using a simple HTML source code that we based around a Campus CLub Connection site.  

During our first meeting, we contemplated wether or not to implement PHP code to process email addresses.  We attempted to do this without the use of MySql.
